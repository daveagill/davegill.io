      <description>So I am the happy owner a shiny new self-built PC and so far I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased with it.
This is the first time I have built my own computer and, really, this is the first desktop PC I have owned (although I pretty much exclusively used my parent&amp;rsquo;s desktop when I lived at home). Until now I have been a laptop-man. I&amp;rsquo;m on my second laptop currently and it&amp;rsquo;s probably close to being replaced with a new one soon.</description>
