      <description>Why did I want to install a new Android? I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting up with an annoying issue on my S3-mini (GT-I8190N) for a few months now - the screen will take forever (many seconds) to wake up if the phone&amp;rsquo;s been sleeping for a while. Even worse is that this will even happen when someone is ringing me!
Most people would probably deal with it, but it bugs the hell out of me and a factory reset didn&amp;rsquo;t help.</description>

      <title>The WordPress Scheduler: wp-cron.php</title>

      <description>So, I recently noticed that my site was not doing its automatic backups. In fact it had never done a backup and I simply had not bothered to check!
I use UpdraftPlus to do my site backups, it is a WordPress plugin that zips up the database and uploaded files and sends them to you (I have it send them to my DropBox). After a bit of investigation and following some of the debug steps on their site I came to the conclusion that it must be WordPress&amp;rsquo;s internal scheduler to blame.</description>
