      <description>So the other day I got an early birthday present courtesy of my lovely girlfriend, an Arduino Mega2560 purchased from CPC.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only had a few hours to play around with it so far, but I have a basic circuit and Sketch (which is Arduino parlance for the C program that is to be uploaded to the ATmega chip), as you can see&amp;hellip;
   It is really basic at the moment, the program listens for input from the button and every time you press it either pauses or unpauses the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) in-and-out fading of the LED.</description>
