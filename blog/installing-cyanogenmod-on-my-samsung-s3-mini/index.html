<h2 id="why-did-i-want-to-install-a-new-android">Why did I want to install a new Android?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been putting up with an annoying issue on my S3-mini (GT-I8190N) for a few months now - the screen will take forever (many seconds) to wake up if the phone&rsquo;s been sleeping for a while. Even worse is that this will even happen when someone is ringing me!</p>

<p>Most people would probably deal with it, but it bugs the hell out of me and a factory reset didn&rsquo;t help. So I decided it would be a good opportunity to have a go at installing a different version of Android.</p>

<p>My phone was running with 4.1 &lsquo;Jelly Bean&rsquo;, whereas the latest version of Android is 4.4 &lsquo;KitKat&rsquo;, so it was worthwhile an upgrade just to see what&rsquo;s new in KitKat.</p>

<p>After a recommendation from a coworker and a few minutes of research I quickly settled on <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/" title="Cyanogenmod">CyanogenMod</a> as my Android flavour for no reason other than it seems fairly mainstream.</p>

<h2 id="gotcha-s">Gotcha&rsquo;s!</h2>

<p>The first thing I discovered is that it seems that the S3-mini is a relatively obscure device in the world of rooting phones and custom Android versions&hellip;</p>

<p>First off, CyanogenMod is not officially supported on the S3-mini (yet it is on the regular S3, the first Galaxy mini and the S4-mini) fortunately <a href="http://novafusion.pl/s3-mini/" title="NovaFusion - S3-mini">NovaFusion</a> has a respectable-looking unofficial port.</p>

<p>Second of all I really struggled to find any a way to root the phone (and it turns out I didn&rsquo;t even need to!). I tried a number of techniques - all failed.  I didn&rsquo;t get to try this <a href="http://www.androidveterans.com/root-galaxy-s3-mini-install-clockworkmod-recovery/" title="Android Veterans">CF Rootfile</a> approach but that was next on my list. What did work for me was <a href="http://www.mgyun.com/en/getvroot" title="VRoot by mgyun">VRoot</a>, a one-click rooter for Windows which worked perfectly after many other one-click rooters had failed; you just have to get over the fact it&rsquo;s a poorly translated version of a Chinese tool.</p>

<p>Only after having rooted the device did I spot that it wasn&rsquo;t even necessary! Closer inspection of CyanogenMod&rsquo;s <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_i9300" title="Cyanogenmod Install for S3">instructions for the regular S3</a> revealed that Samsung devices come with a special &lsquo;Download Mode&rsquo; (press <strong>Power</strong>, <strong>Home</strong> and <strong>Volume Down</strong> together) from which you can install a custom Recovery image.</p>

<h2 id="download-mode">&lsquo;Download Mode&rsquo;?</h2>

<p>My understanding is that Samsung&rsquo;s &lsquo;Download Mode&rsquo; is akin to Fastboot mode which could only be enabled from an unlocked bootloader, for which you would need a rooted phone. So Samsung kindly side-step all that.</p>

<p>Download Mode allows you to flash ODIN-compatible images (ODIN is a protocol and software package used internally by Samsung and since leaked to the wider world). Rather than using the ODIN software to perform the upload I used <a href="http://glassechidna.com.au/heimdall/" title="Heimdall">Heimdall</a>, as recommended by CyanogenMod&rsquo;s instructions.</p>

<h2 id="flashing-a-custom-recovery-image">Flashing a custom Recovery image</h2>

<p>The image we want to flash isn&rsquo;t Android itself, it is a custom Recovery image. From which we can perform a backup (before proceeding further) and then do the actual install of a new Android system.</p>

<p>The recovery image is a small image that is ordinarily used to perform factory resets and to handle the OTA updating, as well as a few other things. Booting to a recovery image first is just like when you boot to a CD-ROM, Flash-drive or hidden recovery partition first when you are installing a regular OS on a regular computer.</p>

<p>However, the stock recovery image that comes with most phones does not expose functionality for installing custom Android OS images, or for doing full system backups. This is why we need a custom Recovery image.</p>

<p>The most popular Recovery image seems to be <a href="https://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager" title="clockworkmod">clockworkMod</a> and that is what I used.</p>

<p>For the S3-mini I had to deviate from the flashing instructions given by CyanogenMod. The following command would not work:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo heimdall flash --RECOVERY recovery.img --no-reboot
</code></pre>

<p>I worked out that the &ndash;RECOVERY argument refers to the ID of the partition you want to flash, my recovery partition was just called &ldquo;19&rdquo; so I had to use this command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo heimdall flash --19 recovery.img
</code></pre>

<p>A brief Googling indicated that this seemed to be true for other S3-mini users too. Nevertheless I would recommend double-checking! To list the partitions I ran this command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">heimdall print-pit --verbose
</code></pre>

<p>And then I just looked for one that referred to a recovery.img and took its ID (19).</p>

<h2 id="making-a-backup">Making a backup</h2>

<p>Before going any further I wanted a backup of the stock Android image, so I could recover to this if CyanogenMod did not work, or if I screwed something up.</p>

<p>First, boot into the recovery image by pressing <strong>Power</strong>, <strong>Home</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> together.</p>

<p>Within the menu there is an option for making a backup. Actually there are two options, one will put the backup on the phone, the other will but it on the external SD-Card. Obviously choose whichever has the most space available. For me that was the external SD-Card, which is probably the ideal place for it anyway.</p>

<p>I went as far as to copy this off the SDCard onto my PC for safe keeping.</p>

<h2 id="install-cyanogenmod-already">Install CyanogenMod already!</h2>

<p>Finally, time to install CyanogenMod!</p>

<p>The image .zip must be placed on the root of the SDCard. I used <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html" title="Android Debug Bridge">adb</a> to put it there but if you have an external (micro) SD-Card and reader then you can just drag-and-drop.</p>

<p>It is also important to pre-load some Google Apps, otherwise you&rsquo;ll have Android but no apps (no Play Store app, GMail, Chrome, etc). Luckily NovaFusion have several app-bundle options - I just went for the full zip bundle, nice and easy. Just place this zip alongside the Android image zip on the root of the SDCard.</p>

<p>The rest is easy. Just boot into the recovery image and there is an option to install new zip packages. Install the OS first and then the app-bundle.</p>

<p>Et Voila!</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts&hellip;</h2>

<p>The experience was relatively painless and went smoothly - no accidental bricking of my phone!</p>

<p>CyanogenMod works well - I have been using it for about a week now - and there haven&rsquo;t been any serious issues. One time I had an email syncing issue which a restart fixed, it is far from clear whether CyanogenMod actually had anything to do with that though.</p>

<p>Only one or two minor things do I miss from Samsung&rsquo;s customised Android. All of which I&rsquo;m sure I could achieve using freely available apps. One of them is having a &lsquo;home&rsquo; screen which is not the far-left one, the default android Launcher (Google Now) always chooses the left-most screen to be the target when you press the Home button. So far these don&rsquo;t bother me :-)</p>

<p>Best of all? <em><strong>My wakeup issue is now fixed!</strong></em></p>
